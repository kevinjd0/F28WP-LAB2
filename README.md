This Lab consists of creating a simple (single player) game of Bear and Bees, where the objective of the game is for bear to avoid getting stung by bees.
The user controls the bear using arrow keys to move in any 2-D directions (up,down,left,right) and user has to avoid the bees that move in random 2-D direction.
This game is made to concentrate on client-side programming using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Objects, Arrays and DOM API.
Also, built without any server interactions so the game can be run locally on any browser as long as source files are accessible.
